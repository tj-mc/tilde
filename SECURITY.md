### Security Considerations

Tilde is a scripting language interpreter that can:
- Execute system commands through shell integration
- Make HTTP requests to external services
- Read and write files through script execution

When using Tilde:
- Only run trusted scripts from known sources
- Be cautious with scripts that make network requests
- Review scripts that interact with the file system
- Consider running untrusted scripts in sandboxed environments

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Script Review**: Always review scripts before execution
2. **Trusted Sources**: Only download scripts from trusted repositories
3. **Network Awareness**: Be mindful of scripts that make external requests
4. **File Permissions**: Understand what file operations a script performs
5. **Environment Isolation**: Use containers or VMs for untrusted code

Thank you for helping keep Tilde and its users safe!

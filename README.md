# `~tilde` üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

**Interpreted Programming Language**

Tilde prioritizes **readability** and **simplicity** above all else. 

With simple `~variable` notation, english-like syntax, and powerful built-ins for modern tasks like HTTP requests and data processing, Tilde makes scripts that anyone can understand.

### Made for Humans

**New to scripting?** Tilde is intuitive and readable - anyone can start coding in 30 seconds! 

**Experienced developer?** Tilde won't get in your way. Write simple automation scripts without fighting the language.

## üß∂ See It In Action

### HTTP & Data Processing
```tilde
~user is get "https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
say "Found user: `~user.name` with `~user.public_repos` repos"
```

### Actions
```tilde
# Compose functionality with actions
action greet-user ~name ~age (
    if ~age >= 18 (
        say "Welcome `~name`! You can access all features."
    ) else (
        say "Hi `~name`! Parental guidance recommended."
    )
)

# Call them with *
*greet-user "Alice" 25
```

### Interactive Automation
```tilde
loop (
    ~username is ask "GitHub username (or 'quit'): "
    if ~username == "quit" break-loop

    ~info is get "https://api.github.com/users/`~username`"
    say "`~info.name` has `~info.public_repos` public repositories"
    wait 5
)
```

## Performance Testing

For comprehensive performance testing, benchmarking, and profiling documentation, see:

üìä **[PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md)**

### Quick Performance Commands:
```bash
# Compare Tilde vs Bun performance
cd benchmark_comparison && ./run_benchmarks.sh

# Identify bottlenecks (lexing vs parsing vs evaluation)
cargo run --bin performance_main your_program.tilde

# Track performance over time
./tools/production_benchmarks.sh
```
